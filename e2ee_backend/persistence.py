"""Durable JSON-file persistence for the device store.

The whole server state is kept in one versioned JSON document. A missing file
is created on first use; a corrupted file or a document whose version is not
understood makes the server refuse to start (state is never silently
discarded). Every change is written atomically: serialize to a temporary file
in the same directory, ``fsync`` it, then ``os.replace`` it over the target,
so a crash never leaves a half-written state file.

Persistence is transactional with respect to the in-memory store: the change
hook fires while the store lock is held (the mutation is visible but not yet
committed to callers). When the durable write succeeds it becomes the new
last-known-good state. When writing the temporary file, ``fsync`` or the
atomic replace fails (an :class:`OSError`), the previous last-known-good state
is restored into memory under the same lock, the old state file is left
untouched, any temporary file is cleaned up by :meth:`JsonStateStore.save`,
and :class:`PersistenceUnavailable` is raised so the HTTP layer answers
503/field=data_file. The failed mutation therefore never advances either
memory or the file.
